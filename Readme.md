Please carefully follow these clarifications and updates while doing the lab:

1. Q2: The letter “y” is NOT considered a vowel.

2. Task Execution: Complete your work only in the cells not marked as Q.

    - After Task 3, you must filter out rows with None values.

    - ⚠️ Be careful not to drop any additional rows by mistake.

    - Your final DataFrame must still contain more than 100 rows after this procedure.

3. Number Lists: If you need to type a list of numbers, separate them with commas, e.g.:

"0.57, 0.179, 0.239"

4. Q15.3: There are multiple possible observations. Please choose the largest value.

5. Q16.4 & Q16.5: The word "quantile" should be understood as “quartile”.
